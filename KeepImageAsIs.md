How to keep the image as is with the updated prompt:

```
Keep everything in the image exactly the same — style, lighting, character, background, composition, and all details — except for [specific change].

"Keep the entire image exactly the same — including color tone, perspective, background, and character design. The only change I want is: replace the girl with a man in his 40s, with long black hair and thick glasses. Do not alter any other part of the image."

Make a minimal edit to the image. Treat it like photo editing: just update [X] and leave everything else pixel-perfect unchanged.
```

## Final:
```
Keep the entire image exactly the same — including color tone, perspective, background content, character design, style, lighting, and composition overall. The only change I want is: XXXXXXX.
Do not alter any other part of the image.
```
