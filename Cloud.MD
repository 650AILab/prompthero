# Cloud Only Prompt

Prompt 1
```
Create Hyper-realistic 2D animation-style sky filled with massive, fluffy cumulus clouds during twilight. The clouds are voluminous and densely packed, with golden light softly glowing from their inner edges, creating a magical layered effect.
The sky is a deep blue-teal gradient, transitioning from light at the bottom to dark at the top. The clouds appear highly textured and three-dimensional, with strong contrast between illuminated and shadowed areas.
Inspired by Studio Ghibli and Makoto Shinkai cloudscapes, with painterly lighting, soft color transitions, and anime-like rendering.
